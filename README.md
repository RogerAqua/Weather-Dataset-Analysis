# Weather Analysis Using Python

# Introduction 
This project focuses on analyzing a time-series weather dataset to uncover patterns and trends. By addressing specific data-related queries, the goal is to derive actionable insights from the data, such as identifying unique weather conditions, understanding temperature variations, and summarizing key metrics like wind speed and visibility. The analysis also emphasizes the importance of effective data visualization for better interpretation of results.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this analysis contains hourly data from 2012, capturing various weather-related attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and weather conditions. It provides a foundation for exploring different weather phenomena and their impacts over time.

# Objectives
The primary aim of this analysis is to explore the weather dataset comprehensively to derive meaningful insights. By focusing on key metrics and trends, the analysis will address specific queries related to weather patterns, statistical summaries, and data visualizations. Below are the objectives:

1. **Null Value Handling**<br/>
• Identify and remove any null values present in the dataset to ensure data integrity.<br/>

2. **Unique Weather Conditions Identification**<br/>
• Determine all unique weather conditions recorded in the dataset.<br/>

3. **Column Renaming**<br/>
• Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition' for improved clarity.<br/>

4. **Filtering Clear Weather Records**<br/>
• Extract all data entries where the weather condition is exactly Clear.<br/>

5. **Statistical Analysis**<br/>
• Compute the mean values of temperature, wind speed, and visibility for summary statistics.<br/>

6. **Pressure Variance Analysis**<br/>
• Calculate the variance in atmospheric pressure across the dataset.<br/>

7. **Wind Speed and Temperature Correlation**<br/>
• Identify instances where wind speed > 30 km/h and temperature > 0°C.<br/>

8. **Snow Analysis**<br/>
• Find dates and corresponding temperatures where snow was recorded.<br/>

9. **Temperature-Time Trend Visualization****<br/>
• Create a graph to illustrate the variation of temperature over time.<br/>

10. **Weather Condition Distribution Visualization**<br/>
• Develop a pie chart to represent the percentage distribution of different weather conditions.<br/>
