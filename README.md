# Weather Analysis Using Python

# Introduction 
This project focuses on analyzing a time-series weather dataset to uncover patterns and trends. By addressing specific data-related questions, the goal is to extract actionable insights from the data, such as identifying unique weather conditions, analyzing temperature variations, and summarizing key metrics like wind speed and visibility.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this analysis contains hourly data from 2012, recording temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather conditions. The analysis aims to explore this data for better understanding and visualization of weather trends.

# Objectives
1. **Null Value Handling**
• Identify and remove any null values present in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

2. **Unique Weather Conditions Identification**
• Determine all unique weather conditions recorded in the dataset.

3. **Column Renaming**
• Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition' for improved clarity.

4. **Filtering Clear Weather Records**
• Extract all data entries where the weather condition is exactly Clear.

5. **Statistical Analysis**
• Compute the mean values of temperature, wind speed, and visibility for summary statistics.

6. **Pressure Variance Analysis**
• Calculate the variance in atmospheric pressure across the dataset.

7. **Wind Speed and Temperature Correlation**
• Identify instances where wind speed > 30 km/h and temperature > 0°C.

8. **Snow Analysis**
• Find dates and corresponding temperatures where snow was recorded.

9. **Temperature-Time Trend Visualization****
• Create a graph to illustrate the variation of temperature over time.

10. **Weather Condition Distribution Visualization**
• Develop a pie chart to represent the percentage distribution of different weather conditions.
